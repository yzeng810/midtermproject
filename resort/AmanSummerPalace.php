		<h2>Discover The Resort</h2>
			<p>Just a few steps from the East Gate of the Summer Palace grounds lies Aman at Summer Palace - the ideal location from which to discover both the history and energy of the Chinese capital. Housed in a series of pavilions, the resort is only 15km from the Forbidden City. A serene retreat, the property provides easy access to such cultural landmarks as the Great Wall, The Temple of Heaven and the hutongs, as well as Beijing's restaurants, art galleries and other contemporary delights. Aman Summer Palace offers a selection of heritage-imbued dwellings, including those once used by guests awaiting an audience with the Empress</p>

				<p>One of the world’s richest repositories of ancient monuments, Beijing is home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the 260-year-old Summer Palace, the gates of which sit at Aman Summer Palace’s doorstep. In addition to the palace’s sculpted grounds and masterful architecture, nearby opportunities for discovery can be found at the Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and in the maze of artists’ workshops spread across the metropolis.</p>

				<p>Rooms and Suites surround serene garden courtyards crisscrossed by stately pathways. Established indigenous trees cast delicate shadows through bamboo blinds and into the lofty-ceilinged Suites. Polished to a deep lustre, floors are finished in Jin clay tiles, while ceilings show exposed wooden roof beams. Bathrooms are generously proportioned with free-standing island bathtubs.</p>
