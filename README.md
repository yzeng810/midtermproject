## Choreography

- Rationale for this order
  - Start from the All Resorts tab, readers can browse all resorts to see the scope of the website, what resorts are included in the website and if there's any resort in particular they are looking for more info.
  - If readers they do not have anything in particular and the scope of this website fits his/her interests, they can proceed to explore the following tabs which are presented according to the theme of resorts and the occassions of travelers 
  - These themes are in order according to their popularity, from most popular to the least. 
- Reasons for no Home buttom in navigation

## Application of Z-pattern

### Location

- Index Page

### Reasons for choosing Z-pattern for index page

- Z-pattern emphasizes calls-to-action and applies to page that feature smaller contents, and the primary goal of index page is to introduce the website with smaller content and ask reader to subscribe for newsletter. 

### Reasons for contents in each quadrant

- Point #1: Since it's primary optical area, it's the best place to show the name of the website.
- Point #2: Because it's the center area of the page, and the primary goal of this website is to present information about the topic, putting navigation here can let readers to immediately start browsing information about the topic.
- Point #3: Since the primary goal of this website is to present information about resort, here I want to entice readers to start browsing the website by showing two overview of the best resort I've chosen for this season. 
- Point #4: Here is the call-to-action, and it is intended to let readers start browsing the website. The link to start browsing the website is a link to the first resort ranked by alphabet.

## Application of F-pattern

### Location 

- Resort Page

### Reasons for choosing F-pattern for resort page

- There are many contents in the resort page but readers rarely read them all, so it is better to use F-pattern and put those more important one to where is most viewed by readers.

### Reasons for the layout

<!--From Top to Bottom, and From Left to Right-->

- Top to bottom order of the page is arranged based on the order of importance, from the most important to the least.

- Navigation Bar
  - Left: Since its the spot to place the most important content, I chose to display the name of the resort 
  - Right: The secondary goal of this website is to have readers subscribe to a newsletter, and the right point of top line is a hotspot to grab attention. 
- First Section - Headline
  - Headline of the resort page is a picture with the resort name
  - Headline is the most important place to grab users' attentions, and considering the contents of this website -resorts, the best way to grab users' attentions is a symbolic picture of the resort which shall let users visualize themselves in the resort and interest them to keep reading. 
  - I chose not to present more info because I consider that w
  - Even though the standard of F-pattern may suggest that I place the H2 level heading on the left side, I prefer to text align it in the center of the image because it is more blended into the picture and shows more emphasis of the h2 level heading. 
- Second Section - Discover the resort 
  - The first content section always grabs the most attentions among all other content sections. Therefore, I chose to present an overview of the hotel, including adventures, dinning and accommondations. 
  - Left: Comparing with the text element, I believe that header with an important and representative picture is more important. Therefore, I placed it on the very left. Readers may not need to read the text. They can feel it in the picture element 
  - Right: On the rightside, I choose to display the less important content - text. 
  - I didn't choose to display any relevent but unrelevent content on the rightest side because the style of this website tends to be more minimalism and I'm trying to display only those relevent content to make it clean and easy to read.
  - And the order inside this section is according to order of an vacation day:  play, eat and rest.
- Third Section - One of a kind, Fourth Section - Gallary, *Fifth Section - More Info 
  - Starting from these sections, contents becomes less important, and these contents are more for people to scan through instead of carefully viewed. Therefore, there is no intended left and right section of these sections as I believe that these sections have hardly any fixations.
  - *Fifth Section has a side-by-side layout because of the information flow - after reading all the information, the readers might want to make a reservation, therefore, there's a reservation link at the end. However, as this website 's primary goal is to present information instead of making reservation, I put it in the very end where does not grab many attentions in a F-pattern page. 
- Overall 
  - The vertical line of F-pattern is achieved through each headings: Discover the resort, One of a kind, Gallary and  More info 
  - The horizontal line is achieved:
    - Headlines
    - Discover the resort Section 
  - The blank part in F is achieved through least important sections
